Udacity - Linear Algebra Refresher Course
> This course helps me refresh the basics of linear algebra,
> and guides me to code my own personal python library, such as vector... 

## Library
Following are my own personal library of linear algebra functions

### vector.py
* norm - return the length of the vector
* unit - return unit vector
* angle - return the angle between two vectors
* proj - return the projected vector 
* is_parallel - return if two vectors are parallel
* is_orthogonal - return if two vectors are orthogonal

### plane.py
* set_basepoint - set coordinate of basepoint 
* is_parallel - return if two planes are parallel
* is_orthogonal - return if two planes are orthogonal

### line.py
* set_basepoint - set coordinate of basepoint
* is_parallel - return if two vectors are parallel
* is_orthogonal - return if two vectors are orthogonal
* is_equal - return if two lines are equal
* intersection - return coordinate of basepoint
